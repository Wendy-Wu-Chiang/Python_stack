Practice using the Django Shell to run ORM commands to manipulate our database
Create a new project called single_model_orm with an app called users_app.
Using the following ERD, complete the tasks listed below:



Create a model called User following the ERD above  

-->class User(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
    email_address = models.EmailField(unique = True)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now = True)

    def _str_(self):
        return f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name}'

Create and run the migration files to create the User table in your database  
-->first active my environment--> then cd in to the project that I am going to work with-->
then run these orders in terminal:  python manage.py makemigrations-> enter->python manage.py migrate->
python manage.py shell-->from users_app.models import * ->

Create a .txt file where you'll save each of the queries you'll run in the shell  
Run the shell and import your User model 

Query: Create 3 new users  
->User.objects.create(first_name="Michael", last_name="Chiang", 
email_address="michael@gmail.com", age=35)
User.objects.create(first_name="Kai", last_name="Chen", email_address="kai@gmail.com", age=5)
User.objects.create(first_name="Fred", last_name="Chen", email_address="fred@gmail.com", age=5)


Query: Retrieve all the users  
-->user.objects.all()

Query: Retrieve the last user  Query: Retrieve the first user 
-> User.objects.last()        ->User.objects.first()

Query: Change the user with id=3 so their last name is Pancakes.  
-> Kai=User.objects.get(id=3)

Query: Delete the user with id=2 from the database 
--> Michael=User.objects.get(id=2)
-->User.objects.get(id=2).delete()


Query: Get all the users, sorted by their first name 
-->User.objects.order_by('first_name') 

BONUS Query: Get all the users, sorted by their first name in descending order 
Submit your .txt file that contains all the queries you ran in the shell
